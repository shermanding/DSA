From portfolio management to\r\nderivative pricing, I am a firm believer that the quintessential\r\nmathematics and programming will be able solve multiple complex\r\nproblems. Using programming tools at disposal to conduct unbiased\r\nanalysis, information procurement, predict markets and an armada of\r\nalgorithms should help assist in executing trades at optimal times\r\nwithout the continuous need for human intervention.\r\nI enjoy working on cutting edge projects that may enable new\r\ntechnologies to participate in the proliferation of quantitative\r\ntrading. The systematic revolution has only just begun, and I hope to be\r\nable to contribute to the world of investing through mathematics and\r\nprogramming, and to create a direct impact on the real world.\r\nBackground\r\nI am currently pursuing a Masters degree in Quantitative Finance from\r\nSingapore Management University (SMU). I currently work within the\r\nalgorithmic investment team in a Robo-Advisory investment firm with a\r\nfocus on global equities/fixed income portfolio creation, back-testing\r\nstrategies, and automation. I have had previous experiences in the asset\r\nmanagement area, specifically in an asia macro hedge fund, as well as a\r\nsingle family office, working on strategy optimization and research\r\n(with quantitative focus).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
