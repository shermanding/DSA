## Introduction

I am a research analyst at a capital markets family office covering US/China equities and Fixed Income. Strategies that I run for discretionary portfolio are macro and event-driven. Focus on TMT sector and traditional fundamental valuations. I am currently pursuing a Master's in Quantitative Finance with the hope to transition towards quantitative research and systematic trading using computational finance and statistical inference.
